Graduated as a Electronic Engineering bechelor student and spare no effort on learning computer and software
out of class. I am specially fond of the mechanism and mathematical basis, so I tend to have different 
interpretation from the usual ones regarding computer and software.

Started self teaching computer science proactively in various MOOC platform, 
like [Coursera][coursera], [MITOCW][mitocw], iTunesU, [Stanford Online][stanonline], etc,
and have taken dozens of classes, if not hundreds, together with other materials.

I am a very good functional programmer as well, the actual one. Currently getting very much into different
aspects of functional programming fields, like monadic programming, type system, statical analysis, optimization,
lambda calculus, etc.

A list of languages:

* C
* Python
* Java
* Scala
* Haskell

Also a vim maniac.

Currently live and work in Montreal, Canada, by writing scala.
